# WebApplication-Java-JSP


This is the final course project for NYU course CS6083 Principles of Database Systems.

For this project I designed an online bidding application using multiple tools and frameworks.

For more details please read Report.pdf.

Some screenshots of the application have also been uploaded.

I received a grade of A on this project.
